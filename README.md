# babrGL
Named after the nickname I have for my wife, this is a 2D OpenGL engine/game.

This is probably not written well but has been a learning experience for me.
It is posted in its entirety as a Visual Studio Project but contains a "Framework" that is used as the underlying game engine.
Licenses attached-- this uses GLFW, SOIL, GLEW, and SoLoud.
